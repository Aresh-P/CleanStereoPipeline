This repo contains a simple pipeline for stereo calibration and depth estimation as defined in `utils.py`, with implementations of the abstract classes in `stereo_sources.py` (get images from livestream or directory), `calib_models.py` (create rectification maps from image data), and `stereo_matchers.py` (estimate disparity). The matchers include OpenCV's SGBM and will soon include other models, which will require their own virtual environments to run.
